<!-- ## Abstract
This work introduces a univariate conditional variational autoencoder (CVAE) for designing morphogenic patterns in frontal polymerization-based manufacturing. Frontal polymerization (FP) is a rapid and energy-efficient manufacturing process for thermoset polymers and composites, where controlling the morphogenic patterns is critical for achieving desired material properties.
The proposed CVAE framework enables efficient and accurate control over pattern formation by learning the relationship between process parameters and resulting morphologies. The model leverages a univariate conditional structure to simplify the learning process while maintaining high accuracy. Numerical experiments demonstrate the CVAE's ability to predict and design morphogenic patterns under various manufacturing conditions, paving the way for advanced control in FP-based manufacturing processes. -->
