## Abstract
This work presents an extended ordinary state-based peridynamics (XOSBPD) model for the non-spherical horizons. Based on the OSBPD, we derive the XOSBPD by introducing the Lagrange multipliers to guarantee the non-local dilatation and nonlocal strain energy density (SED) are equal to local dilatation and local SED, respectively. In this formulation, the XOSBPD removes the limitation of spherical horizons and is suitable for arbitrary horizon shapes.

In addition, the presented XOSBPD does not need volume and surface correction and allows non-uniform discretization implementation with various horizon sizes. Four classic examples demonstrate the accuracy and capability for complex dynamical fracture analysis. The proposed method provides an efficient tool and in-depth insight into the failure mechanism of structure components and solid materials.
