## Abstract
In this paper, we present a revised non-ordinary state-based peridynamics (RNOSBPD), which works for the arbitrary interaction domain and does not require surface correction and volume correction. For the spherical interaction domain, RNOSBPD recovers non-ordinary state-based peridynamics (NOSBPD) of the published work. This current work also presents a new approach to couple the RNOSBPD with {FEM} (RNOSBPD-FEM). This new coupling approach is straightforward and is easily introduced into commercial finite element codes. With this coupling method, special techniques, such as overlapping regions, interface elements, or fictitious nodes, that have published in the literature for coupling PD with FEM are not needed. Four static applications are performed and the results show the accuracy and efficiency of the RNOSBPD-FEM.
