## Abstract
Machine-learning-based surrogate models offer significant computational efficiency and faster simulations compared to traditional numerical methods, especially for problems requiring repeated evaluations of partial differential equations. This work introduces the Geometry-Informed Neural Operator Transformer (GINOT), which integrates the transformer architecture with the neural operator framework to enable forward predictions for arbitrary geometries.

GINOT encodes the surface points cloud of a geometry using a sampling and grouping mechanism combined with an attention mechanism, ensuring invariance to point order and padding while maintaining robustness to variations in point density. The geometry information is seamlessly integrated with query points in the solution decoder through the attention mechanism.

The performance of GINOT is validated on multiple challenging datasets, showcasing its high accuracy and strong generalization capabilities for complex and arbitrary 2D and 3D geometries.
